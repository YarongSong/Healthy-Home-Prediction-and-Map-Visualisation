# Healthy-Home-Prediction-and-Map-Visualisation

Welcome to the Health Home Prediction and Map Visualisation project! This repository houses a comprehensive data science initiative focused on exploring the relationship between respiratory risk and environmental factors such as air pollution and geographic location. My analysis integrates diverse data sources—including air pollution measurements, spatial geometry, health indicators, and risk assessments—with additional geospatial layers like road networks and intersections.

Project Overview
Objective:
To investigate how air pollution and urban infrastructure (roads and intersections) influence respiratory health risks. This project leverages predictive modeling and spatial analysis to uncover patterns and potential correlations between environmental exposure and health outcomes.

Data Sources:

Air Pollution Data: Metrics on pollutants impacting air quality.
Geometric Data: Spatial coordinates and shapes that define the studied area Auckland, California.
Health Indicators and Risks: Quantitative measures of respiratory health outcomes and associated risk factors.

Methodology:

EPSG Visualisation: We use EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) codes to accurately transform and visualise geospatial data, ensuring that road networks, intersections, and other spatial features are correctly mapped.
Data Integration: Additional layers such as roads and intersections are merged with the original datasets, enriching our analysis and providing a robust framework to assess how location influences respiratory risk.
Predictive Analysis: By combining environmental data with health indicators, we aim to predict respiratory risks based on both air quality and spatial dynamics.
This repository includes all the necessary code, data, and documentation to reproduce our findings and extend the analysis. This project helps us deepen the understanding of environmental impacts on public healthand how to achieve a healthy home environment.
